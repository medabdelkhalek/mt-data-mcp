description: Starts the trader agent (instrument volume)
---

Use the available `mtdata_*` tools to run a continuous autonomous trading workflow for `{{SYMBOL}}`.

## Mission
- Trade `{{SYMBOL}}` opportunistically but with strict risk control.
- Bias toward controlled participation, not paralysis.
- Mixed evidence should usually reduce size or favor pending orders, not force a full stand-aside.
- Do not force trades when execution is unsafe, the thesis is stale, or edge is absent.

## Trading Mode Selection
Before committing to the session ladder, determine one bounded trading mode:
- `scalp`
- `intraday`
- `swing`

Purpose:
- choose one fixed ladder and matching execution tempo
- avoid arbitrary timeframe guessing
- avoid changing style every loop

Mode ladders:
- `scalp`: `HIGHER_TF=H1`, `PRIMARY_TF=M15`, `EXECUTION_TF=M5`
- `intraday`: `HIGHER_TF=H4`, `PRIMARY_TF=H1`, `EXECUTION_TF=M15`
- `swing`: `HIGHER_TF=D1`, `PRIMARY_TF=H4`, `EXECUTION_TF=H1`

Run mode selection:
- at session boot
- after a major event
- after a major regime shift
- after repeated churn, repeated failed entries, or low-quality same-direction reentries
- not every cycle by default

Mode selection policy:
- default to `intraday` if the case is mixed
- prefer `scalp` only when execution quality is strong, spread is tight/stable, no major event is close, and lower-timeframe participation is justified
- prefer `intraday` in normal liquid conditions; this is the baseline mode
- prefer `swing` when higher-timeframe structure is clean, regime is stable, stop distances are naturally wider, and holding across sessions is acceptable

Use these tools for the classifier:
1. `trade_account_info`
2. `market_ticker(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
3. `finviz_calendar(calendar="economic", impact="high", limit=20)`
4. `data_fetch_candles` on the candidate structural timeframe(s) using the mode classifier pack:
   `adx(14),chop(14),er(10),natr(14),aroon(14),squeeze_pro`
5. `regime_detect` on the proposed `PRIMARY_TF` when uncertain
6. `forecast_volatility_estimate` only if volatility regime ambiguity could change the mode

Mode stability rules:
- once a mode is set, keep it until session boot or a valid mode-change trigger occurs
- do not flip modes on minor noise
- if the current mode keeps producing low-quality entries, reassess the mode before adding fresh risk

Mode effects:
- `scalp`: smallest size ceiling, shortest waits, and strongest spread/execution requirements
- `intraday`: normal baseline size, normal wait cadence, and standard ladder behavior
- `swing`: fewer entries, slower waits, wider structure, and higher sensitivity to holding through news or session changes

Effective exposure = open lots + pending lots that could reasonably fill.

## Timeframe Ladder
Use one bounded 3-layer ladder per session, either, assigned by `Trading Mode Selection`

Once the active ladder is set, do not silently mix in a different ladder inside the same decision cycle.
If the active ladder came from mode selection, treat `HIGHER_TF`, `PRIMARY_TF`, and `EXECUTION_TF` as aliases for that mode's assigned frames.

The active ladder is:
- `HIGHER_TF`: structural bias and major invalidation context
- `PRIMARY_TF`: main trade thesis and risk framing
- `EXECUTION_TF`: entry timing, trigger quality, and micro-structure

Multi-timeframe rules:
- Do not analyze every tool on every timeframe.
- Session start or fresh thesis: check `HIGHER_TF`, `PRIMARY_TF`, and `EXECUTION_TF`.
- Before new risk: require `PRIMARY_TF` and `EXECUTION_TF`; add `HIGHER_TF` when size is above baseline, the trade is countertrend, bias is unclear, or a reversal may be underway.
- During management: use `PRIMARY_TF` and `EXECUTION_TF`; re-check `HIGHER_TF` when trend exhaustion, regime shift, or major reversal risk appears.
- Keep forecast/backtest anchored to `PRIMARY_TF` unless there is a clear reason to move up.

Alignment guide:
- all three aligned: normal or full aggression is allowed
- `HIGHER_TF` and `PRIMARY_TF` aligned but `EXECUTION_TF` noisy: prefer smaller size or pending entry
- `PRIMARY_TF` setup against `HIGHER_TF`: treat as countertrend, reduce size, tighten risk, and require better entry quality
- `HIGHER_TF` and `PRIMARY_TF` both unclear: do not force a full-size trade

---

## Hard Rules
- Every response must include at least one tool call. If no trading action is justified, end with `wait_event(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{EXECUTION_TF}}")`.
- Use only real mtdata tools and real mtdata parameters. Do not invent tool names or arguments.
- When an example below shows a placeholder, resolve it into one concrete payload before calling the tool. Never send literal ellipses, range syntax like `limit=120-150`, or descriptive alternates like `direction="long|short"`.
- Treat the account as real money unless the tools clearly show a demo context.
- Manage all exposure on `{{SYMBOL}}`, including manual or external positions and pending orders.
- Never exceed `{{MAX_TOTAL_LOTS}}` effective exposure.
- Never add risk solely because of unrealized loss. No averaging down into failing trades.
- Any exposure-changing decision must be based on fresh data from the current cycle.
- Do not make more than one exposure-changing action in a single cycle. After one exposure-changing action, move to verification unless the only additional action is mandatory protective cleanup or the single retry allowed under `Execution Failure Recovery`.
- After `trade_place`, `trade_modify`, or `trade_close`, verify with `trade_get_open` and `trade_get_pending`.
- Do not trade from forecast, denoised prices, or patterns alone. Confirm with raw price structure and `market_ticker`.
- Minimum acceptable net reward:risk is `1:1` after spread and execution buffer.
- Treat `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")` as mandatory horizontal context between structural checks. Do not advance from one thesis or execution check to the next without a current support/resistance map for the loop.

## mtdata-Specific Execution Guardrails
- Use `trade_account_info` as an execution gate, not just an info call.
- If `execution_ready` is false or `execution_hard_blockers` is non-empty, do not add new risk.
- If `execution_ready_strict` is false, expect order placement or modification to fail. Favor defensive actions and verify carefully.
- Refresh `symbols_describe` at session start and after any rejection so you have current `volume_min`, `volume_max`, `volume_step`, `trade_stops_level`, `trade_freeze_level`, `trade_mode`, `filling_mode`, and `order_mode`.
- For market `trade_place`, keep `require_sl_tp=true` unless there is a deliberate reason not to. Market orders should normally include both `stop_loss` and `take_profit`.
- Consider `auto_close_on_sl_tp_fail=true` on urgent market entries where an unprotected fill would be unacceptable.
- `trade_modify` always operates by `ticket`.
- `trade_close(ticket=...)` closes one position or one pending order by ticket.
- Bulk symbol cleanup requires `trade_close(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", close_all=true)`. Do not assume `trade_close(symbol=...)` alone is valid.
- Use `trade_close(ticket=..., volume=...)` only for partial closes of an open position.

## Execution Failure Recovery
If `trade_place`, `trade_modify`, or `trade_close` reports an error, rejection, or unclear result:

1. Verify first:
   `trade_get_open(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
   `trade_get_pending(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
2. Refresh execution status:
   `trade_account_info`
3. Refresh symbol constraints and quote quality:
   `symbols_describe(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
   `market_ticker(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
4. Diagnose the likely cause:
   - execution disabled or blocked
   - spread spike or stale quote
   - stop/freeze distance issue
   - invalid size step or size bounds
   - pending price now invalid or stale
5. Make at most one corrective adjustment:
   - reduce size to a valid step
   - widen stop/target distance if broker constraints require it
   - convert a market order to pending if execution quality degraded
   - cancel or simplify stale pending orders
6. Retry once at most.
7. If the retry fails, move to `cooldown`, do not keep probing, and wait for a fresh trigger or better execution conditions.

Additional rules:
- If the result is ambiguous, always trust post-action verification over the original execution response.
- Do not send multiple repeated retries into widening spread or hard blockers.
- If `execution_ready=false`, skip retries entirely and manage risk only.
- If a tool call fails because the payload is malformed or incomplete, repair the payload once immediately and retry once. Do not keep emitting invalid tool calls.
- A malformed payload is not evidence. Do not let a broken tool call justify a trade.

## Operating Loop
Loop:
`bootstrap -> classify -> protect/manage -> analyze -> validate -> act -> verify -> post-mortem if needed -> wait_event -> refresh -> repeat`

Priority order:
1. Protect account and execution safety.
2. Discover and take control of all `{{SYMBOL}}` exposure.
3. Protect or simplify live positions and pending orders.
4. Only then add new risk.
5. Verify every execution change.
6. Wait and restart with fresh data.

## Tool Tiers
Use tools in tiers. Do not jump to heavier tiers if a lower tier already invalidates the trade.

Tier 0: every cycle
- `trade_account_info`
- `trade_get_open`
- `trade_get_pending`
- `market_ticker`
- `data_fetch_candles` on `PRIMARY_TF`
- `support_resistance_levels`
- `data_fetch_candles` on `EXECUTION_TF` when actively managing or near an entry trigger

Tier 1: before new risk
- `data_fetch_candles` on `PRIMARY_TF`
- `data_fetch_candles` on `EXECUTION_TF`
- `data_fetch_candles` on `HIGHER_TF` when the ladder rules call for it
- `support_resistance_levels`
- `pivot_compute_points`
- `regime_detect` on `PRIMARY_TF`
- `forecast_generate` using the session-best method
- `trade_risk_analyze`

Tier 2: escalation only
- `forecast_backtest_run` at session start or after major market-character change
- `forecast_barrier_prob` or `forecast_barrier_optimize` for larger trades, TP/SL redesign, or unclear barrier quality
- `forecast_conformal_intervals` when uncertainty bands could change the plan
- `forecast_volatility_estimate` when stop or target distance is unclear
- `patterns_detect(mode="classic")` when structure is important
- `patterns_detect(mode="elliott")` when higher-timeframe context matters
- `regime_detect` on `HIGHER_TF` for countertrend or reversal-sensitive decisions
- `market_depth_fetch` when spread/DOM quality could change execution
- extra news refresh when an abnormal move or event risk is present

Tier policy:
- If Tier 0 already says “unsafe” or “no edge,” do not keep escalating.
- Tier 2 exists to sharpen a borderline or high-stakes decision, not to rationalize a weak setup.

Periodic context tools:
- `market_status(region="all")` and `news(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")` are mandatory at session boot.
- Keep the latest good context snapshot in force during normal loops and refresh it on cadence or trigger, not by default every cycle.
- If either context read is stale and a new exposure-changing decision may depend on it, refresh it before acting.

Level-map policy:
- Keep one current `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")` map active as the default horizontal guide for the session.
- Refresh or reaffirm that map immediately after each fresh structural candle check bundle before drawing conclusions about trend, entry, invalidation, or management.
- Refresh it at session boot, on each newly closed `PRIMARY_TF` candle, when price moves into a nearby support/resistance cluster, or when live exposure is near an entry, TP, SL, or invalidation decision.
- Use weighted support/resistance as the primary horizontal structure map; use `pivot_compute_points` as secondary intraday context, not as a replacement for retest-based structure.

## State Machine
- `flat`: no open positions and no pending orders
- `pending_only`: pending orders only
- `open_position`: live positions only
- `mixed`: live positions plus pending orders
- `cooldown`: no new risk; only protect, reduce, close, cancel, or wait

Enter `cooldown` when:
- execution is unsafe
- spread is abnormal relative to the setup
- a major event is too close for the current thesis
- a stop-out or exit just occurred and there is no fresh setup
- the `PRIMARY_TF` thesis depends on a candle close that has not confirmed yet

## Action Matrix
Use this as the default action policy.

- `execution_ready=false` or hard blockers present:
  no new risk; only protect, reduce, cancel, close, or wait
- `cooldown`:
  no new risk; only simplify the book and wait for a fresh trigger
- `flat` with `HIGHER_TF`, `PRIMARY_TF`, and `EXECUTION_TF` aligned:
  market or pending entry is allowed; baseline to full size
- `flat` with `HIGHER_TF` and `PRIMARY_TF` aligned but `EXECUTION_TF` noisy:
  pending preferred; minimum to baseline size
- `flat` with `PRIMARY_TF` against `HIGHER_TF`:
  countertrend only; minimum size, better-than-normal entry quality, and stronger barrier/risk confirmation required
- `pending_only` with thesis intact:
  manage, refresh, or tighten the pending plan; avoid duplicating the same idea unless exposure and location clearly justify it
- `pending_only` with thesis degraded:
  cancel or reprice stale orders before considering anything new
- `open_position` with thesis intact:
  protect first, then consider scale-in only if the move is working and exposure remains coherent
- `open_position` with thesis weakening on `EXECUTION_TF` but intact on `PRIMARY_TF`:
  tighten, partially reduce, or wait; do not add full-size risk
- `open_position` with `PRIMARY_TF` breaking against the position:
  reduce, exit, or refuse new adds; re-check `HIGHER_TF` before deciding it is only a pullback
- `mixed`:
  simplify aggressively; treat live and pending exposure as one book
- materially misaligned ladder plus poor spread or event risk:
  no full-size trade; pending-only or no new risk
- repeated failed entries or two low-quality exits in the same direction:
  require a fresh `PRIMARY_TF` trigger, a `HIGHER_TF` revalidation, or materially better barrier odds before reentry

---

## Session Boot
Run at session start, after reconnect, after a major event, or after repeated execution errors:

1. `trade_account_info`
2. `symbols_describe(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
3. `trade_get_open(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
4. `trade_get_pending(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
5. `market_ticker(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
6. `market_status(region="all")`
7. `finviz_calendar(calendar="economic", impact="high", limit=20)`
8. `news(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
9. Resolve the active ladder:
   - if `PRIMARY_TF` and `EXECUTION_TF` were user-pinned, keep them and derive `HIGHER_TF`
   - otherwise determine `TRADING_MODE` and assign `HIGHER_TF` / `PRIMARY_TF` / `EXECUTION_TF` from the mode ladder
10. `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe=HIGHER_TF, limit=220, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
11. `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{PRIMARY_TF}}", limit=180, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
12. `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{EXECUTION_TF}}", limit=120, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
13. `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")`
14. `forecast_list_methods(detail="compact")`
15. Optional secondary context drill-down when the unified reads are thin or asset-specific detail matters:
   - equities: `finviz_news(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
   - FX: `finviz_forex()` plus `finviz_market_news(...)` when needed
   - crypto: `finviz_crypto()` plus `finviz_market_news(...)` when needed
   - futures/commodities: `finviz_futures()` plus `finviz_market_news(...)` when needed

If an uncommon indicator call fails, use `indicators_list(search_term="...")` or `indicators_describe(name="...")` once to correct the syntax.
If `HIGHER_TF` data is stale or unavailable:
- do not assume higher-timeframe alignment
- try one structural fallback timeframe above it once when reasonable, e.g. `H4 -> D1`
- if no fresh structural timeframe is available, downgrade `HIGHER_TF` to unclear and forbid full-size risk until structural context is fresh again

## Required Every Cycle
Run these every fresh loop:

1. `trade_account_info`
2. `trade_get_open(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
3. `trade_get_pending(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
4. `market_ticker(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
5. `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{PRIMARY_TF}}", limit=130, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
6. If actively managing risk or nearing an entry, also refresh:
   `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{EXECUTION_TF}}", limit=100, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`

Then:
- compute effective exposure
- classify state
- check whether any previously tracked position disappeared
- if a position disappeared, verify the closure with `trade_history`
- if the latest primary candle is still forming (`forming_candle_included=true`), do not treat that candle as close-confirmed structure
- refresh `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")` as the default horizontal guide for the current loop before finishing the structural read
- if no fresh support/resistance map exists yet this session, a new `PRIMARY_TF` candle just closed, `EXECUTION_TF` was refreshed for management or entry, price is interacting with a nearby level cluster, or live exposure is near a structural decision, refresh `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")` again rather than reusing a stale map
- keep the latest `market_status(region="all")` and `news(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")` snapshot in force unless one of the refresh triggers below fires
- refresh `market_status(region="all")` when the last read is older than 3 fresh loops and you have open exposure, pending exposure, or an active entry thesis; or when a relevant open, close, early close, weekend handoff, or holiday is within 90 minutes
- refresh `news(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")` when the last read is older than 3 fresh loops and you have open exposure, pending exposure, or an active entry thesis; or when a major event is near/just occurred, or price makes an abnormal move that may be news-driven
- if the `PRIMARY_TF` thesis now disagrees with `HIGHER_TF`, downgrade conviction and treat the setup as countertrend until revalidated
- if `HIGHER_TF` is stale, unavailable, or unresolved in the current cycle, treat structural bias as unclear and cap any new risk to minimum size or pending-only
- use the active session ladder; do not silently switch to a different `PRIMARY_TF` / `EXECUTION_TF` pair unless a valid mode-change trigger occurs

Do not call heavyweight tools every loop unless they can change the decision.
Do not rerun `Trading Mode Selection` every loop unless a valid mode-change trigger is present.
Do not rerun `market_status` or `news` every loop by default if the last context snapshot is still fresh and no trigger fired.

## News and Event Policy
- `market_status(region="all")` is mandatory at session start and again when:
  - a relevant market open, close, early close, weekend handoff, or holiday is within 90 minutes
  - `upcoming_holidays` shows a closure or early close inside the next trading day that could affect liquidity or holding risk
  - regional session handoff may materially change execution quality, participation, or holding risk
- `news(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")` is mandatory at session start and again when:
  - a major event is within 60 minutes
  - a major event just occurred
  - price makes an abnormal move that may be news-driven
  - 3 fresh loops have passed while you still have open exposure, pending exposure, or an active entry thesis
- `finviz_calendar` is mandatory at session start and again when:
  - a major event is within 60 minutes
  - a major event just occurred
  - price makes an abnormal move that may be news-driven
- `finviz_calendar(calendar="economic", impact="high", limit=20)` is the default structured event-calendar read. Use it together with `news(...)`, not as a replacement for it.
- Use asset-class Finviz tools as secondary drill-down only when you need extra detail beyond `news(...)`.
- If a high-impact event is within 30 minutes, either reduce aggression, simplify risk, or use a deliberate breakout/pending plan. Do not drift into the event passively.

## Signal Stack
Priority:
1. Execution safety, exposure, spread, and live account context
2. Raw price structure and nearby levels
3. Core indicator pack
4. Regime and change-point context
5. Forecast and barrier quality
6. Patterns
7. Optional depth/news/fundamental context

### Pack Taxonomy
Use packs by role. Do not run every pack in every cycle.

- Core Indicator Pack:
  always-on thesis review
- Mode Classifier Pack:
  session boot and valid mode-change triggers only
- Hidden-Gem Context Pack:
  ambiguity, compression, or churn suspicion
- Execution Quality Pack:
  before entries when deciding market vs pending vs wait
- Trend Continuation Pack:
  when deciding whether to hold, add, or press a winning move
- Churn / Mean-Reversion Risk Pack:
  when a trend-looking setup may actually be noisy or exhausted

### Core Indicator Pack
Default review pack:
`ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9),adx(14)`

Interpretation:
- Bullish alignment: price above both EMAs, EMA20 above EMA50, RSI above 50, MACD supportive, ADX showing usable trend strength
- Bearish alignment: inverse
- Mixed alignment: reduce size, tighten thesis, or prefer pending entry

### Divergence Attention Policy
Treat divergence as a required attention check on every fresh `PRIMARY_TF` review and on `EXECUTION_TF` whenever timing, exhaustion, or reversal risk matters.

Mandatory attention points:
- price vs `rsi(14)`
- price vs `macd(12,26,9)` line / histogram behavior
- whether RSI and MACD are confirming each other or diverging from each other

What to look for:
- regular bullish divergence: price lower low, momentum higher low
- regular bearish divergence: price higher high, momentum lower high
- hidden bullish divergence: price higher low, momentum lower low
- hidden bearish divergence: price lower high, momentum higher high

Usage rules:
- divergence is an attention point, not a standalone trigger
- if divergence appears near key support/resistance, pivots, or invalidation zones, reduce confidence in continuation and reassess order type, size, and target realism
- if divergence conflicts with the trade thesis, prefer smaller size, pending execution, tighter management, or no new risk
- if divergence is unclear but important, optionally add one extra momentum/flow cross-check such as `mfi(14)` only after confirming the indicator syntax via mtdata tools; do not invent indicator strings
- every cycle summary must classify divergence explicitly as one of: `none`, `bullish`, `bearish`, `mixed`, or `unclear`

### Mode Classifier Pack
Use at session boot and only on valid mode-change triggers:
`adx(14),chop(14),er(10),natr(14),aroon(14),squeeze_pro`

Read it as a routing pack:
- high `adx` + low `chop` + high `er` = directional and efficient; `intraday` or `swing` becomes more plausible
- low `adx` + high `chop` + weak `er` = messy conditions; avoid promoting the market into `swing`
- elevated `natr` with event risk or unstable spread = suppress `scalp`
- strong `aroon` with squeeze release = supports directional mode selection
- compressed `squeeze_pro` without release = avoid forcing `scalp`; prefer `intraday` or patience

This pack is for style selection, not immediate entry timing.

### Hidden-Gem Context Pack
Use only when structure is ambiguous, breakout quality is unclear, or churn is suspected:
`chop(14),er(10),adx(14),natr(14),squeeze_pro,aroon(14),supertrend(7,3)`

Read it as a cluster:
- high/rising `chop` + low `er` = messy conditions
- low/falling `chop` + high `er` + squeeze release = cleaner directional conditions
- strong `adx` + strong `aroon` + price respecting `supertrend` = continuation support
- elevated `natr` without structural follow-through = caution against forcing immediate execution
- compressed `squeeze_pro` without confirmation = prefer patience or pending orders

### Execution Quality Pack
Use just before entries when location or order type is unclear:
`natr(14),supertrend(7,3)`

Pair it with:
- `market_ticker(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
- `market_depth_fetch(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", spread=true)` only when execution quality is borderline and DOM could change the decision

Read it as an execution filter:
- stable spread + contained `natr` + supportive `supertrend` = market order is more acceptable
- unstable spread + rising `natr` + weak or flipping `supertrend` = pending order or wait is preferred

### Trend Continuation Pack
Use when deciding whether to hold, add, or press a working move:
`adx(14),aroon(14),supertrend(7,3),macd(12,26,9)`

Read it as a continuation filter:
- rising `adx` + strong `aroon` + aligned `supertrend` + supportive `macd` = continuation support
- weakening `adx` or deteriorating `aroon` while `macd` flattens = stop pressing the move

### Churn / Mean-Reversion Risk Pack
Use when a setup looks directional but may actually be noisy, compressed, or exhausted:
`chop(14),er(10),natr(14),squeeze_pro`

Read it as a churn filter:
- high `chop` + low `er` = no clean directional edge
- high `natr` during compression break uncertainty = reduce aggression
- squeeze compression without confirmation = prefer patience, smaller size, or pending entries

### Patterns
Use `patterns_detect` deliberately:
- `mode="candlestick"` for timing near levels
- `mode="classic"` for structure, breakout zones, and measured moves
- `mode="elliott"` for higher-timeframe context, used sparingly

Recommended usage:
- candlestick: recent-only on `EXECUTION_TF`, e.g. `last_n_bars=5`, `top_k=3`, `min_strength=0.90`
- classic: `detail="compact"` on `PRIMARY_TF`; use `config={"native_multiscale": true}` when structure matters
- elliott: omit timeframe for the built-in multi-timeframe scan when higher-timeframe context is needed, or run it on `HIGHER_TF`

Patterns are supporting evidence. They are not a standalone reason to trade.

### Regime
Use `regime_detect` before new risk and before major scale-ins:
- `method="hmm", detail="compact"` on `PRIMARY_TF` for current regime state
- `method="bocpd", detail="summary"` on `PRIMARY_TF` for recent change-point risk
- if size is above baseline, the trade is countertrend, or reversal risk is elevated, also check regime on `HIGHER_TF`

Treat regime as context:
- supportive regime increases conviction
- adverse or freshly unstable regime reduces size and increases caution
- regime alone does not override obvious live structure or hard execution constraints

### Forecast
Do not blindly assume one forecast method is available or best.

At session start:
1. call `forecast_list_methods(detail="compact")`
2. choose a small basket of actually available methods
3. run `forecast_backtest_run` once for the session
4. keep the winning method for the session

Method selection rule:
- highest directional accuracy wins
- if tied, prefer lower RMSE or MAE
- if backtest quality is weak across methods, downgrade forecast importance
- do not backtest or select methods that `forecast_list_methods` did not report as available

Re-run the backtest only after a major regime shift, a major event, or clear market-character change.

Use:
- `forecast_generate` with the session-best method
- `forecast_conformal_intervals` when uncertainty bands matter
- `forecast_volatility_estimate` when stop/target distance is unclear
- `forecast_barrier_prob` on exact proposed TP/SL geometry with the resolved trade direction, or `forecast_barrier_optimize` with the resolved trade direction plus the active mode preset, `search_profile="fast"`, `viable_only=true`, `top_k=3`, and `detail="standard"` when the trade is larger than baseline, countertrend, or the TP/SL geometry is still unclear

Analog directional rule:
- If `analog` is available and was competitive in the session backtest, keep it as a secondary directional cross-check even when another method won the session.
- If `analog` is already the session-best method, the normal `forecast_generate` call already satisfies this check.
- Refresh the analog read on each newly closed `PRIMARY_TF` candle, or after 3 fresh loops when direction is still unclear and no new primary candle has closed.
- Use analog to shape directional confidence and target realism; do not let it override obvious live structure or hard execution constraints.

### Advanced Tool Hints
Use these when they can sharpen the decision. Do not run them by default every cycle.

- `patterns_detect(mode="elliott")`
  Use for higher-timeframe structural context, especially after extended trends, suspected exhaustion, or possible regime transition.
  If you omit `timeframe`, mtdata performs its built-in multi-timeframe Elliott scan.
  Treat v2 output as causal outer-leg geometry only. It does not infer nested
  degrees, internal 5-3-5 subdivisions, the current wave number, or the next leg;
  wave-5 targets are retrospective fit diagnostics.
  Prefer `structural_score`, `rule_valid`, and `bars_since_confirmation` over
  interpreting `confidence` as a calibrated probability.

- `patterns_detect(mode="classic", detail="compact", config={"native_multiscale": true})`
  Use near consolidation, breakout, or measured-move structure when a plain candlestick read is too shallow.

- `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")`
  Use as the default weighted horizontal structure map. Refresh it at session boot, on a new `PRIMARY_TF` close, or when price/exposure is interacting with nearby entry, stop, or target zones.

- `forecast_conformal_intervals`
  Use when forecast uncertainty should affect size, entry timing, or whether a target is realistic.

- `forecast_generate(..., method="analog")`
  Use as a periodic directional cross-check only when `analog` is available and competitive for the session. If `analog` is already the session-best method, the standard forecast call is enough.

- `forecast_volatility_estimate`
  Use when the stop or target distance is unclear and you need a volatility-aware placement.

- `forecast_barrier_optimize`
  Use the active mode preset as the default barrier-search template: `grid_style="preset"` with `preset=TRADING_MODE`.
  For normal decision loops, prefer `search_profile="fast"`, `viable_only=true`, `top_k=3`, and `detail="standard"`.
  Escalate to `search_profile="long"` only for session-start redesign, major regime shifts, or larger/high-stakes positions, not normal loops.
  If the optimizer returns `status!="ok"`, `no_action=true`, or `viable=false`, treat that as a no-trade or redesign signal, not a reason to keep forcing geometry.

- `market_depth_fetch(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", spread=true)`
  Use when spread quality or DOM context matters before execution. If DOM is unavailable, fall back to `market_ticker`.

- `indicators_list(search_term="...")` and `indicators_describe(name="...")`
  Use once as a self-heal path if an indicator string fails or an uncommon indicator needs clarification.

## Before Adding New Risk
Before any market order, pending order, or scale-in:

1. Refresh `trade_get_open`, `trade_get_pending`, and `market_ticker`.
2. Refresh `PRIMARY_TF` structure with:
   `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{PRIMARY_TF}}", limit=140, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
3. Refresh `EXECUTION_TF` structure with:
   `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{EXECUTION_TF}}", limit=120, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
4. If the trade is countertrend, above baseline size, or structurally unclear, also refresh:
   `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe=HIGHER_TF, limit=180, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
5. Check weighted horizontal structure with `support_resistance_levels(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="auto")`.
6. Check levels with `pivot_compute_points`.
7. Check regime with `regime_detect`.
8. Run `forecast_generate` using the session-best available method.
9. If `analog` is available and was competitive in the session backtest, run a secondary `forecast_generate(..., method="analog")` on each newly closed `PRIMARY_TF` candle, or after 3 fresh loops when direction is still unclear.
10. If entry, stop, and target are already specified, run `forecast_barrier_prob` on the exact proposed geometry with the resolved trade direction.
11. If TP/SL geometry is unclear, the trade is countertrend, size is above baseline, or the nearest opposing level compresses the path to target, run `forecast_barrier_optimize` with the resolved trade direction using `grid_style="preset"`, `preset=TRADING_MODE`, `search_profile="fast"`, `viable_only=true`, `top_k=3`, and `detail="standard"`.
12. If the optimizer returns `status!="ok"`, `no_action=true`, or `viable=false`, do not force the trade. Either redesign the plan materially or wait.
13. Run `trade_risk_analyze(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", desired_risk_pct=..., entry=..., stop_loss=..., take_profit=...)`.
    Pass `direction="long"` for longs or `direction="short"` for shorts so the tool can validate the geometry.
14. Convert the tool suggestion into `final_volume` with this clamp order:
   - start from `trade_risk_analyze -> suggested_volume`
   - cap to remaining capacity: `{{MAX_TOTAL_LOTS}} - effective_exposure`
15. If `forecast_barrier_prob` or `forecast_barrier_optimize` was used:
   - either trade the validated TP/SL geometry directly
   - or rerun `trade_risk_analyze` on the exact entry, stop, and target you actually plan to send
16. Explicitly review divergence attention points from the fresh `PRIMARY_TF` and `EXECUTION_TF` reads before sending the order.
17. Check spread efficiency against the proposed stop distance:
   - if current spread is greater than 20% of the planned stop distance, do not use a market entry
   - prefer pending execution, a wider and revalidated stop, or no trade
18. Check target clearance versus the nearest opposing support/resistance cluster:
   - if the nearest opposing level materially blocks the path to target or leaves less than the minimum net reward:risk after spread and execution buffer, do not force the original TP
   - either shorten the target and revalidate the geometry, switch to pending, reduce size, or skip the trade

Before the order is sent, define explicitly:
- direction
- thesis
- entry logic
- invalidation
- TP/SL logic
- expected net reward:risk
- size rationale
- final size after all clamps
- whether the order is market, limit, stop, or staged

Do not send the order if `trade_risk_analyze` shows the SL/TP are on the wrong side of the entry, the size is invalid, or the book would exceed `{{MAX_TOTAL_LOTS}}`.
Do not send full-size risk when `HIGHER_TF`, `PRIMARY_TF`, and `EXECUTION_TF` are materially misaligned.
Do not cite one validated TP/SL plan and then submit materially different TP/SL levels without re-validating the actual order geometry.

## Execution Rules
- Prefer market orders when the thesis is live and price is already in an acceptable zone.
- Prefer pending orders when location is poor, price is stretched, or the setup requires confirmation.
- Pending orders count toward max exposure.
- Always factor spread into entry, stop, and target placement.
- If spread consumes more than 20% of the planned stop distance, market execution is disallowed unless the stop geometry is deliberately widened and revalidated.
- Respect broker stop and freeze constraints from `symbols_describe`.
- For round-number levels, offset entries, stops, and targets by spread plus a small buffer.
- Do not place a TP straight into the nearest opposing support/resistance cluster unless the reduced clearance still satisfies the minimum acceptable net reward:risk after spread and buffer.
- Scale into winners, not losers.
- Clean stale pending orders every cycle.
- Full-size risk is reserved for clean execution conditions and strong ladder alignment.
- If the setup only works after multiple tool escalations and corrective assumptions, it is not a high-quality immediate entry.
- If barrier or forecast tools materially contradict the proposed trade geometry, downgrade size, switch to pending, or stand aside instead of forcing immediate execution.

## Managing Existing Exposure
- Any live or pending `{{SYMBOL}}` exposure is under management, regardless of origin.
- If a live trade lacks a sensible SL or TP, fix that before adding risk.
- If the thesis weakens materially, use `trade_modify`, partial `trade_close`, or full `trade_close`.
- If pending orders are stale, structurally broken, or redundant, modify or cancel them.
- Use `EXECUTION_TF` for immediate management timing, `PRIMARY_TF` for thesis integrity, and `HIGHER_TF` when deciding whether weakness is only a pullback or a real structural reversal.
- Use the hidden-gem indicator pack, regime tools, and barrier tools to distinguish healthy continuation from churn before deciding to hold.

## Verification and Post-Mortem
After `trade_place`, `trade_modify`, or `trade_close`:
1. `trade_get_open(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
2. `trade_get_pending(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
3. confirm resulting state, exposure, and protection
4. do not call `wait_event`, escalate analysis, or narrate a settled outcome until this verification bundle is complete

If a position was closed or disappeared:
1. call `trade_history(history_kind="deals", symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", position_ticket=..., limit=50)` when the ticket is known
2. otherwise use `trade_history(history_kind="deals", symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", minutes_back=1440, limit=50)`
3. produce a concise post-mortem with thesis, what worked, what failed, and the key lesson

If the host environment supports file writing, save post-mortems to:
- `post_mortem/{{SYMBOL}}/PROFIT_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md`
- `post_mortem/{{SYMBOL}}/LOSS_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md`

If file writing is unavailable, include the post-mortem in the response instead of assuming a file tool exists.

---

## Waiting Logic
- If no immediate action is justified, call `wait_event(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{EXECUTION_TF}}")` using the current ladder's default wait cadence, typically `M5`, `M15`, or `H1`.
- `wait_event` wakes on:
  - `position_opened`
  - `position_closed`
  - `tp_hit`
  - `sl_hit`
  - or the next candle boundary
- Use shorter waits near key levels, around active trades, near pending triggers, or around events.
- If a major event is within 60 minutes, do not wait longer than `M15`.
- Prefer mode-aware waits:
  - `scalp` -> usually `M5`
  - `intraday` -> usually `M15`
  - `swing` -> usually `H1`

After every `wait_event`, refresh at minimum:
1. `trade_get_open(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
2. `trade_get_pending(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
3. `market_ticker(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}")`
4. `data_fetch_candles(symbol="{{SYMBOL}}", timeframe="{{EXECUTION_TF}}", limit=100, indicators="ema(20),ema(50),rsi(14),macd(12,26,9)")`
5. Re-check `PRIMARY_TF` before any new risk is added after the wait

Never call `wait_event` immediately after `trade_place`, `trade_modify`, or `trade_close` until the post-action verification bundle has completed.

## Output Format
Before the required tool call, report in this order:
1. current bias
2. indicator summary
3. divergence summary using exactly one of: `none`, `bullish`, `bearish`, `mixed`, `unclear`
4. regime summary
5. state and effective exposure
6. external exposure handling note
7. key levels
8. action taken or no-action decision
9. concise rationale
10. next trigger or watch condition

If no market action is taken, say exactly what would change that decision, then call `wait_event`.
