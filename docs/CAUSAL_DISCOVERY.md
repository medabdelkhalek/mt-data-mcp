# Causal Signal Discovery

The `causal_discover_signals` tool performs **pairwise Granger-style causal discovery** between symbols using recent MT5 close prices. It is intended for exploratory analysis (feature discovery / watchlist relationships), not “true causality”.

If you want **co-movement**, use `correlation_matrix`. For a direct two-symbol lead/lag estimate, use `cross_correlation`. For candidate **mean-reverting / spread** relationships, use `cointegration_test`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Compare symbols by correlation strength
mtdata-cli correlation_matrix "EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY" --timeframe H1 \
  --window-bars 500 --method pearson --transform log_return --json

# Use an explicit MT5 group path for easier basket selection
mtdata-cli correlation_matrix --group "Forex\\Majors" --timeframe H1 \
  --window-bars 500 --limit 120 --method pearson --transform log_return --json

# Test an MT5 group for candidate cointegrated pairs
mtdata-cli cointegration_test --group "Forex\\Majors" --timeframe H1 \
  --window-bars 400 --transform log_level --significance 0.05 --json

# Estimate whether the first symbol leads the second
mtdata-cli cross_correlation "EURUSD,GBPUSD" --timeframe H1 \
  --max-lag 20 --transform log_return --json

# Test a multivariate basket with Johansen trace and maximum-eigenvalue tests
mtdata-cli cointegration_test "EURUSD,GBPUSD,EURGBP" --timeframe H1 \
  --method johansen --k-ar-diff 1 --transform log_level --json

# Provide an explicit list of symbols
mtdata-cli causal_discover_signals "EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY" --timeframe H1 \
  --window-bars 800 --max-lag 5 --transform log_return --significance 0.05

# Provide a single symbol to auto-expand its visible MT5 group (e.g., Forex\Majors)
mtdata-cli causal_discover_signals EURUSD --timeframe H1 --window-bars 800
```

## What It Does

### `correlation_matrix`

For each unordered pair of symbols `(A, B)`, the tool:
1. Fetches recent close-price histories
2. Applies a transform (by default `log_return`)
3. Computes pairwise correlations on overlapping transformed samples
4. Returns canonical ranked pair rows plus optional matrix/highlight views

It accepts either:

- an explicit `symbols` list (or compatibility alias `symbol`), or
- a `group` path that matches the MT5 symbol groups exposed by `symbols_list --list-mode groups`

`items` is the canonical compact payload. Each row includes the correlation,
sample count, and pairwise period window; `context` records the timeframe,
`window_bars`, transform, and `min_overlap` used. A requested `limit` records
the output page size, not the analysis sample size. Use `extras=metadata` when you also
need derived convenience views such as `matrix`; omit `extras` to keep only the
ranked pair rows plus summary highlights.

### `cointegration_test`

For each unordered pair of symbols `(A, B)`, the tool:
1. Fetches recent price histories
2. Applies a level-style transform (`log_level` by default)
3. Runs one Engle-Granger test with the first symbol in stable input/group
   order as the dependent series
4. Reports that orientation's p-value, hedge ratio, spread diagnostics, and
   `orientation_policy="left_dependent"`

Engle-Granger is orientation-sensitive. The tool deliberately avoids selecting
the lower p-value after testing both directions because that would cherry-pick
the test result. For a two-symbol request, reverse the input order and run the
tool again when the opposite economic orientation is relevant.

With `method=engle_granger`, it evaluates unordered pairs. With
`method=johansen`, it evaluates the aligned basket jointly and returns
trace/max-eigenvalue rank estimates plus cointegrating vectors. Johansen's
critical-value tables support `significance` values of `0.01`, `0.05`, and
`0.1` only; other values return an `invalid_input` error. Engle-Granger accepts
any significance value strictly between zero and one.

It accepts either:

- an explicit `symbols` list (or compatibility alias `symbol`), or
- a `group` path that matches the MT5 symbol groups exposed by `symbols_list --list-mode groups`

### `cross_correlation`

This tool requires exactly two symbols and evaluates lags from `-max_lag`
through `+max_lag`. A positive best lag means the first symbol leads the second;
a negative lag means the second leads the first. The result includes a
moving-block bootstrap confidence interval for the best-lag correlation.
Because the best lag is selected by maximum absolute correlation, the interval
uses a Bonferroni-adjusted per-lag confidence level to provide 95% family-wise
coverage across all evaluated lags. `best.significant` is true only when that
adjusted interval excludes zero; the context reports the number of lag tests
and both confidence levels.

### `causal_discover_signals`

For each ordered pair of symbols `(cause → effect)`, the tool:
1. Aligns each pair on that pair's overlapping close-price history
2. Applies a transform (by default `log_return`) to improve stationarity
3. Optionally z-scores the series (`normalize=true`)
4. Runs Granger causality tests for lags `1..max_lag`
5. Selects the **best (lowest raw p-value) lag** per pair using `ssr_ftest`
6. Applies Bonferroni correction first across the tested lags, then across all
   successfully tested directed pairs

The primary `p_value` and `significant` fields use this global family-wise
correction. `p_value_raw` is the selected lag's unadjusted value, and
`p_value_lag_adjusted` is corrected only for the lag search. The correction
becomes stricter as the basket grows; use full detail to inspect non-significant
exploratory candidates rather than interpreting an empty compact result as
proof that no predictive relationships exist.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `symbols` | (required) | Comma-separated MT5 symbols. If you pass **one** symbol, mtdata expands to other visible symbols in the same MT5 group. |
| `timeframe` | `H1` | Bar timeframe (`M15`, `H1`, etc.). |
| `window_bars` | `500` | Maximum overlapping transformed samples analyzed per pair. |
| `limit` | all rows | Optional maximum number of ranked result rows returned. |
| `offset` | `0` | Number of ranked result rows to skip before applying `limit`. |
| `max_lag` | `5` | Maximum lag to test (≥ 1). |
| `significance` | `0.05` | Family-wise alpha threshold after Bonferroni correction across tested lags and directed pairs. |
| `transform` | `log_return` | One of: `log_return`, `log_level`, `pct`, `diff`, `level`. |
| `normalize` | `true` | Z-score each series before testing. |

## Output

The tool returns a plain-text table:

```
Effect <- Cause | Lag | p-value | Samples | Conclusion
```

- **Conclusion** is `causal` when the globally Bonferroni-adjusted `p-value < significance`, otherwise `no-link`.
- **Lag** is the best-performing lag for the pair under the selected test statistic.

Tip: `--json` returns the structured payload instead of default TOON text.

## Interpretation and Caveats

- `correlation_matrix`, `cointegration_test`, `causal_discover_signals`, and `market_scan` all accept `symbols` for explicit multi-symbol calls.
- `group` remains mutually exclusive with explicit symbol selectors.

- Use **`correlation_matrix`** when you want a fast view of which symbols move together or in opposite directions.
- Use **`cointegration_test`** when you want candidate pairs or baskets whose price levels may share a stable long-run relationship.
- Use **`causal_discover_signals`** when you specifically want to test whether lagged values of one symbol add predictive information for another.
- Granger causality is a **predictive** notion: “past values of A help predict B” under the model assumptions.
- Results are **pairwise** (not a full causal graph) and can be confounded by common drivers (USD strength, risk-on/off, sessions).
- Use transforms (returns/diffs) and sufficient history; non-stationary levels can produce misleading links.
- Validate any signal with out-of-sample testing before using it in a strategy.

## Dependencies

`causal_discover_signals` and `cointegration_test` require `statsmodels`. If it is not installed, the tools return a readable error message.
