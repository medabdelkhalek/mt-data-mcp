# MT5-native advanced analytics

Five **read-only** tools that go beyond basic candles and scans: tick microstructure, execution quality, robust strategy evidence, portfolio tail risk, and relative strength — all from the connected MetaTrader 5 terminal (no external market-data vendor required for these).

Use them when you already have a research loop and want **execution-aware** or **portfolio-level** depth.

**Dense terms:** [Microstructure](GLOSSARY.md#microstructure) · [Execution quality](GLOSSARY.md#execution-quality) · [Relative strength](GLOSSARY.md#relative-strength) · [VaR / CVaR](GLOSSARY.md#var-value-at-risk) · [Spread](GLOSSARY.md#spread)

**Related:** [Trading risk](TRADING_RISK.md) · [CLI](CLI.md) · [Example workflow](EXAMPLE.md) · [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md)

## Tick microstructure

`market_microstructure_analyze` measures spread distributions, quote-update
intensity, gaps, mid-price volatility, and liquidity-stress windows.

```bash
mtdata-cli market_microstructure_analyze EURUSD --minutes-back 60 --json
```

The result identifies the feed as `quote_only`, `trade_ticks`, or
`trade_volume`. Volume-impact metrics are omitted unless the broker supplies
enough non-zero real trade volume. Quote pressure is a proxy, not centralized
FX order flow.

MT5 tick rows are complete snapshots. The analyzer uses the `flags` bitmask to
identify trade events, so a quote update that repeats the last price and volume
is not counted as another trade.

## Execution quality

`trade_execution_quality` joins MT5 deal history to order history and nearby
ticks. It reports side-aware slippage, latency, partial fills, fees, and
post-fill markouts.

```bash
mtdata-cli trade_execution_quality --symbol EURUSD --minutes-back 43200 \
  --markout-seconds 1,5,30 --detail full --json
```

Positive slippage is worse for the trader; positive markout is favorable.
Unmatched or unbenchmarked fills are counted rather than silently discarded.

## Fixed-candidate chronological validation

`strategy_validate` evaluates predeclared built-in or forecast-threshold
candidates with anchored expanding chronological folds. Outcomes must finish
inside their test fold; prior calibration samples are horizon-purged and
embargo bars are excluded. Evidence uses block-bootstrap expectancy tests with
Holm correction and reports `positive`, `negative`, or `inconclusive`.

```bash
mtdata-cli strategy_validate EURUSD --timeframe H1 --lookback 3000 \
  --candidates '[{"id":"fast-cross","type":"builtin_strategy","strategy":"ema_cross","params":{"fast_period":10,"slow_period":30}}]' \
  --barrier '{"horizon":12,"tp_pct":0.5,"sl_pct":0.5}' --json
```

Candidate parameters are fixed before validation; this tool does not optimize
and validate on the same sample.

Forecast-threshold candidates execute at most the latest 200 eligible forecast
anchors to keep validation bounded. Their folds partition that computed signal
window rather than empty earlier history. Each candidate reports signal range,
requested/evaluated folds, skipped-fold reasons, and fold coverage; incomplete
coverage cannot receive a positive evidence classification.

Same-bar TP/SL touches default to `sl_first` and are echoed in the result.

## Portfolio risk decomposition

`portfolio_risk_decompose` maps current MT5 positions into account-currency
filtered-historical scenarios. It returns multi-horizon VaR/Expected Shortfall,
component ES, concentration, prescribed stresses, and optional proposed-trade
incremental ES and margin.

```bash
mtdata-cli portfolio_risk_decompose --timeframe H1 --lookback 1000 \
  --horizon-bars 1,5 --confidence 0.95,0.99 --json
```

The default fails closed if a material position cannot be priced safely. Use
`--allow-partial true` only when an explicitly partial portfolio result is
acceptable. Fail-closed coverage includes both live sensitivity pricing and
the completed return history required by the scenario model. Partial results
list every omitted symbol and the omission stage in `data_quality`.

The perfect-positive-correlation stress applies a common one-sigma factor to
horizon marginal volatilities. Opposing sensitivities therefore offset.

## Relative strength and breadth

`market_relative_strength` ranks a bounded MT5 universe with volatility-scaled,
factor-adjusted momentum across several horizons. It also reports breadth,
rank stability, live spread, and data-coverage exclusions.

```bash
mtdata-cli market_relative_strength --group "Forex\\Majors" --timeframe H1 \
  --horizons 5,20,60 --weights 0.2,0.3,0.5 --limit 10 --json
```

Use homogeneous symbol groups when possible. Instruments with substantially
different trading sessions can produce less comparable cross-sectional ranks.

## Data caveats

- Historical tick and candle availability is controlled by the broker and the
  terminal's local history.
- FX `tick_volume` is a broker tick count, not traded lots.
- `last` and `volume_real` are commonly zero for OTC instruments.
- DOM is not required by these tools and remains a separate, gated live
  snapshot through `market_depth_fetch`.
- Volume-impact estimates describe only the connected broker's tick feed,
  even when `volume_real` is present.
- The focused FastAPI/Web UI does not expose these tools in v1; use MCP or the
  dynamic CLI.
