# Regime Detection

Regime detection identifies the current market "behavior mode" (trending, ranging, volatile). Different strategies work in different regimes.

## Why Regimes Matter

Markets cycle through distinct behavioral phases:

| Regime | Characteristics | Strategy Implication |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Low Volatility / Ranging** | Price oscillates in a band | Mean reversion works; trend-following fails |
| **Trending** | Directional momentum | Trend-following works; mean reversion fails |
| **High Volatility / Crisis** | Large unpredictable swings | Reduce size or stay out |

A strategy that profits in one regime may lose in another. Regime detection helps you:
1. **Filter trades:** Only enter when conditions match your strategy
2. **Adjust sizing:** Reduce risk in unfavorable regimes
3. **Detect breakouts:** Identify when the market is transitioning

## Methods

### 1. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

**What it does:** Classifies each bar into one of N hidden "states" based on return and volatility patterns.

**How it works:**
1. Assumes the market switches between N underlying states
2. Each state has characteristic mean return and volatility
3. Uses observed data to estimate which state is currently active

The implementation is a Gaussian HMM with an estimated transition matrix.
`params.inference=filtered` is the default and uses observations through each
bar under parameters fitted on the requested window. Use
`params.inference=smoothed` only for retrospective segmentation because it uses
later observations. State changes are confirmed causally by `min_regime_bars`.
Model parameters are still fitted on the requested analysis window, and canonical
state IDs are ordered by full-window state means. Historical canonical IDs are
therefore retrospective labels; use rolling `as_of` calls for point-in-time tests.

**Example:**
```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method hmm --params "n_states=2"
```

**Output:**
```
summary:
  last_state: 0
  state_shares:
    0: 0.623
    1: 0.377
  state_sigma:
    0: 0.000303   # Low volatility state
    1: 0.000739   # High volatility state
```

**Interpretation:**
- **State 0:** Low volatility (σ = 0.0003) — ranging/quiet market
- **State 1:** High volatility (σ = 0.0007) — trending/active market
- Currently in State 0 (low volatility)

State IDs are ordered by ascending mean return, not by volatility. The example's
State 0 happens to be the low-volatility state; always use
`state_sigma[last_state]` to read the current state's fitted volatility.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `n_states` | 2 | Number of regimes to detect |
| `inference` | `filtered` | `filtered` for live interpretation or `smoothed` for retrospective segmentation |

**When to use:**
- Ongoing regime classification
- Filtering strategies by market type
- Multi-day to multi-week analysis

### 2. Change-Point Detection (BOCPD)

**What it does:** Detects moments when the market's statistical properties changed.

**How it works:**
- Bayesian Online Change Point Detection
- Estimates probability that each bar marks a regime transition
- Doesn't classify regimes—just detects when changes occur

**Example:**
```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method bocpd --threshold 0.5
```

**Output:**
```
summary:
  last_cp_prob: 0.471
  max_cp_prob: 0.471
  change_points_count: 0
```

**Interpretation:**
- `last_cp_prob: 0.471` — 47% probability that a regime change just occurred
- Below threshold (0.5), so not flagged as a change point
- Higher probabilities indicate likely structural breaks

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | auto | Probability cutoff to flag a change point. Omit it for automatic asset/timeframe calibration; any supplied number, including `0.5`, is fixed. |
| `lookback` | timeframe-based | Recent window used for BOCPD summary statistics in compact/summary detail. `limit` controls the detection history. |

**When to use:**
- Detecting breakouts
- Alerting on market structure changes
- Invalidating stale forecasts

---

### 3. PELT Change-Point Detection

**What it does:** Segments the return series at structural breaks using the Pruned Exact Linear Time algorithm from `ruptures`.

```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method pelt \
  --params "model=rbf penalty=auto min_size=5 jump=1"
```

Supported cost models are `l1`, `l2`, `rbf`, `normal`, and `ar`. Set a numeric `penalty` for explicit sensitivity or keep `penalty=auto` for a variance-scaled default.

**When to use:**
- Retrospective structural-break detection
- Segmenting history before fitting forecasts
- Confirming breaks suggested by BOCPD

---

### 4. Markov-Switching AR (MS-AR)

**What it does:** Combines HMM with autoregressive modeling. Each regime has its own AR parameters.

**Example:**
```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method ms_ar --params "n_states=2 order=1"
```

Use `n_states` to choose the number of regimes.
Like HMM, MS-AR defaults to filtered probabilities. Set
`params.inference=smoothed` only for retrospective analysis.

**When to use:**
- When regime changes affect both mean and autocorrelation structure
- Academic research contexts

---

### 5. Clustering (`clustering`)

**What it does:** Groups bars into regimes using distance-based clustering (e.g. KMeans on return/volatility features). Does not assume a hidden Markov structure.

The scaler, optional PCA, cluster model, and canonical state ordering are fitted
on the full requested window. Clustering output is descriptive; reproduce live
behavior with rolling `as_of` calls. `min_regime_bars` confirmation itself is causal.

**Example:**
```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method clustering --params "n_states=3"
```

Use `n_states` to choose the number of regimes; legacy aliases are ignored.

### 6. Gaussian mixture (`gmm`)

`gmm` is independent Gaussian soft clustering. It has no transition matrix or
Markov persistence and must not be interpreted as an HMM state filter.

**When to use:**
- Exploratory regime discovery without a parametric model
- When HMM convergence is unstable

---

## Practical Strategies

### Strategy 1: Regime Filter

Only enter trend-following trades when HMM detects high-volatility state:

```bash
# Check current regime
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method hmm --params "n_states=2"

# If state_sigma shows current state is high-volatility:
#   → Enable trend-following entries
# If current state is low-volatility:
#   → Disable trend-following or switch to mean reversion
```

### Strategy 2: Change-Point Alert

Monitor for regime transitions and reduce exposure when detected:

```bash
# Check for recent change points
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method bocpd --threshold 0.6

# If last_cp_prob > 0.6:
#   → Tighten stops
#   → Reduce position size
#   → Consider closing positions
```

### Strategy 3: Regime-Conditional Barrier Analysis

Run barrier optimization separately for each regime:

```bash
# In low-volatility regime: tighter barriers
mtdata-cli forecast_barrier_optimize EURUSD --timeframe H1 --horizon 12 \
  --tp-min 0.15 --tp-max 0.5 --sl-min 0.1 --sl-max 0.4

# In high-volatility regime: wider barriers
mtdata-cli forecast_barrier_optimize EURUSD --timeframe H1 --horizon 12 \
  --tp-min 0.5 --tp-max 2.0 --sl-min 0.3 --sl-max 1.5
```

## Output Contract

### Compact TOON Output (Default)
```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method hmm
```
Shows regime segments: start time, end time, duration, state ID.

### JSON Output
```bash
mtdata-cli regime_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --method hmm --json
```
Returns structured JSON for programmatic use.

Canonical fields for successful compact/full JSON responses:

| Field | Applies to | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| `method` | all methods | Actual implementation method. `hmm` and `gmm` are distinct. |
| `current_regime` | all methods | Uses `regime_id`, `label`, `since`, `bars`, and `regime_confidence` when those concepts apply. BOCPD also includes transition-oriented fields such as `status` and `transition_risk`. |
| `regimes` | all compact/full methods | Uses `start`, `end`, `bars`, and `regime_confidence` consistently where regime confidence applies. |
| `regime_info` | state/rule methods | Describes regime labels and statistics. Clustering labels are derived from return/volatility when available instead of opaque `regime_N` names. |
| `reliability` | all methods | Always includes `confidence`, `reliability_label`, and `source`; method-specific diagnostics may add more fields. |
| `warnings` | as needed | Explains accepted parameters that do not apply to the selected method. |

`current_regime.regime_confidence` and `regimes[].regime_confidence` are the canonical regime-confidence keys. Reliability diagnostics keep their own `reliability.confidence` field.

**Method-specific meaning of `regime_confidence`:**

| Method | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `hmm`, `gmm`, `ms_ar`, `clustering`, … | Average posterior probability of the assigned state over the segment (classification confidence). |
| `bocpd` | Segment **stability**: `1 - mean(change-point probability)` over bars in the segment. High values mean low internal CP mass (stable stretch). Boundary evidence is separate: `transition_prob_at_start` and `avg_transition_prob`. |

Do not treat BOCPD `regime_confidence` as "how sure we are of a bullish/bearish label"; BOCPD segments are change-point intervals, and bias labels (when present) come from post-change return statistics.

Volatility words in state labels (`low_vol`, `high_vol`, `quiet`, and
`volatile`) rank the fitted states within that run. They are not absolute
thresholds and should not be compared across symbols or timeframes. Use the
numeric `volatility` / `volatility_pct` fields for quantitative comparisons.

### Parameter applicability

Use `n_states` as the canonical state-count parameter for HMM/GMM, MS-AR, clustering, GARCH, wavelet, and ensemble.

`threshold` only applies to BOCPD change-point detection. If supplied for non-BOCPD methods, the tool reports a warning rather than silently changing confidence filtering.

For `rule_based`, use `params.window_bars` to choose the analysis window. `lookback`, `min_regime_bars`, and `max_regimes` do not change rule-based output because it emits one current-window regime; non-default uses are reported in `warnings`.

### Heuristic state counts

Some methods use a heuristic to choose `n_states` when it is not explicitly supplied:

| Method | Auto-detection basis |
|--------|----------------------|
| `garch` | Realized-volatility percentile spread plus return kurtosis |
| `ensemble` | Return-distribution kurtosis |

These rules control output granularity; they are not AIC/BIC model selection and
do not estimate the true number of market regimes. Set `n_states` explicitly and
compare out-of-sample or backtest results when the state count affects a strategy.
GARCH and ensemble can choose different counts on the same data because their
heuristics use different inputs.

The ensemble defaults to `hmm`, `clustering`, and `wavelet`. Ensemble voters
must emit state IDs canonicalized by return, so supported overrides are
`hmm`, `gmm`, `ms_ar`, `clustering`, and `wavelet`. BOCPD/PELT change points,
rule-based labels, and GARCH volatility tiers are different concepts and are
rejected as ensemble voters instead of being mapped into the same state-ID
space. Use those methods separately as transition or volatility gates.

#### GARCH volatility tiers

The `garch` method fits a single GARCH model to estimate conditional
volatility, then bins that path into ordered volatility tiers. By default the
cut points are percentiles of the full analysis window, so labels such as
`low_vol` and `high_vol` are relative within that run and can change when the
window changes. With two states, `params.vol_threshold` selects an explicit
absolute cut point instead. The output reports `threshold_scope` and
`volatility_thresholds` in `params_used`.

This method is not a Markov-switching GARCH model and does not estimate latent
regime dynamics. AIC, BIC, and log likelihood are exposed as `model_fit`
diagnostics only; they are not converted into a generic regime-confidence
score.
