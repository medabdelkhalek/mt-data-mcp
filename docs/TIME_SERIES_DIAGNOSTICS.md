# Time-Series Diagnostics

These read-only tools analyze recent MT5 bars before forecasting, modeling, or risk decisions.

## Stationarity

`stationarity_test` runs ADF and KPSS from `statsmodels`; Phillips-Perron is also available when the `arch` extra is installed.

```bash
mtdata-cli stationarity_test EURUSD --timeframe H1 --lookback 500 \
  --target log_return --tests adf,kpss,pp --json
```

ADF and PP use a unit-root null hypothesis, while KPSS uses a stationarity null. The combined `conclusion` is `stationary`, `non_stationary`, `mixed`, or `inconclusive`.

## Automatic Seasonality

`seasonality_detect` combines autocorrelation peaks with a periodogram and ranks candidate periods in bars.

```bash
mtdata-cli seasonality_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --lookback 1000 \
  --target log_return --min-period 2 --max-period 168 --json
```

The dominant period is exploratory evidence, not proof of a stable calendar effect. Confirm it on separate history.

## Bar Outliers

`outliers_detect` scores returns, volume, and high-low range with MAD, IQR, or z-scores.

```bash
mtdata-cli outliers_detect EURUSD --timeframe H1 --lookback 500 \
  --fields return,volume,range --method mad --threshold 3.5 --json
```

Use `--detail full` to include field-level scores and OHLC values for each flagged bar.

## Volatility Term Structure

`volatility_term_structure` compares current realized volatility with its historical distribution across multiple rolling horizons.

```bash
mtdata-cli volatility_term_structure EURUSD --timeframe H1 --lookback 1000 \
  --horizons 1,5,10,20,60 --percentiles 10,25,50,75,90 --json
```

By default values are annualized decimal volatility. Set `--annualize false` for per-bar decimal volatility.
For intraday data, annualization uses the median observed bars per complete UTC
session multiplied by the symbol-class calendar (365 crypto, 260 FX, or 252
other sessions). The response reports both inputs and the resulting basis.

## Typical Workflow

1. Run `outliers_detect` to identify data or event-driven anomalies.
2. Run `stationarity_test` on the exact transform intended for modeling.
3. Use `seasonality_detect` to propose candidate seasonal periods.
4. Use `volatility_term_structure` to place current risk in historical context.
