# Sample trade workflow

A friendly, step-by-step research walkthrough for **short-term EURUSD analysis** using mtdata. Each step shows **which tool**, **why those inputs**, and **how to read the output** — no quant background required.

This is a **research example**, not financial advice. Numbers below are illustrative of one historical session; re-run the commands on live data for current levels.

**Terms used:** [EMA / RSI / MACD](GLOSSARY.md#moving-average) · [Pivot points](GLOSSARY.md#pivot-points) · [EWMA vol](GLOSSARY.md#ewma-exponentially-weighted-moving-average) · [Theta](GLOSSARY.md#theta-method) · [Edge](GLOSSARY.md#edge) · [Monte Carlo barriers](GLOSSARY.md#monte-carlo-simulation) — full [glossary quick find](GLOSSARY.md#quick-find).

## 1. Pull the most recent price data (candles)

| Tool | Call | Why we used it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **`data_fetch_candles`** (H1) | `symbol=EURUSD`, `timeframe=H1`, `limit=200`, `indicators=EMA(20), EMA(50), RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9)` | <ul><li>**H1** = one‑hour bars – the natural granularity for short‑term (intraday) analysis.</li><li>200 bars give us roughly the last 8‑9 days of data, enough to see the current trend.</li><li>Adding **EMA‑20** and **EMA‑50** lets us see whether price is above or below short‑ and medium‑term moving averages (a quick trend check).</li><li>**RSI** (Relative Strength Index) shows if the market is “over‑bought” (>70) or “over‑sold” (<30).</li><li>**MACD** (Moving‑Average Convergence Divergence) tells us whether momentum is positive or negative.</li></ul> |
| **Result** | A table with columns `time,open,high,low,close,EMA_20,EMA_50,RSI_14,MACD,MACDh,MACDs`. The last few rows (the most recent hours) show: <br>‑ Price ≈ 1.1776 <br>‑ EMA‑20 ≈ 1.1754, EMA‑50 ≈ 1.1739 <br>‑ RSI ≈ 65 <br>‑ MACD line > signal (positive) | **Interpretation** <br>‑ Price is **above both EMAs** → bullish alignment. <br>‑ RSI is in the “strength” zone but not over‑bought. <br>‑ MACD histogram is near zero, meaning momentum is still positive but weakening – a possible short‑term pause. |

## 2. Get the daily price range for pivot‑point calculation

| Tool | Call | Why we used it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **`data_fetch_candles`** (D1) | `symbol=EURUSD`, `timeframe=D1`, `limit=30`, `ohlcv=ohlc` | <ul><li>Pivot points are traditionally calculated from the **previous day’s** high, low and close.</li><li>30 daily bars give us a recent history to confirm that the most recent day is representative.</li></ul> |
| **Result** | A table with the last 30 daily bars (open‑high‑low‑close). The most recent day (15 Sep) shows: <br>‑ High = 1.17745, Low = 1.16569, Close = 1.17608 | This daily H‑L‑C will be fed into the next step. |

## 3. Compute classic pivot‑point levels

| Tool | Call | Why we used it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **`pivot_compute_points`** | `symbol=EURUSD`, `timeframe=D1` | <ul><li>Each run returns classic, Fibonacci, Camarilla, Woodie, and DeMark tables so you can compare support/resistance ladders.</li><li>Every method lists **support (S1, S2, …)** and **resistance (R1, R2, …)** tiers that traders monitor.</li></ul> |
| **Result** | JSON with: <br>‑ Pivot (PP) = 1.17505 <br>‑ R1 = 1.17848 <br>‑ S1 = 1.17264 <br>‑ R2, S2, R3, S3 also provided. | **Interpretation** <br>‑ Current price (≈ 1.1776) sits **just below R1** and **above the pivot** – a classic “test‑and‑break” situation. <br>‑ If price falls, S1 (1.17264) is the first support; if it breaks above R1, the next target is R2 (≈ 1.1809). |

Use **`confluence_levels`** when you want the pivot ladder ranked against data-driven support/resistance and Fibonacci swing levels. It highlights zones where independent methods cluster, such as a daily pivot resistance sitting within a few pips of an H1 resistance retest and a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

## 4. Estimate near‑future volatility

| Tool | Call | Why we used it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **`forecast_volatility_estimate`** | `symbol=EURUSD`, `timeframe=H1`, `horizon=12`, `method=ewma`, `params={lambda:0.94}` | <ul><li>**EWMA** (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) gives a quick, robust estimate of recent volatility.</li><li>`lambda=0.94` is the standard smoothing factor used in many risk‑models (e.g., RiskMetrics).</li><li>`horizon=12` means we want the volatility for the next 12 hourly bars (≈ ½ day).</li></ul> |
| **Result** | <ul><li>Hourly σ (standard deviation) ≈ 0.000593 → **≈ 5.9 pips** per hour.</li><li>12‑hour σ ≈ 0.002055 → **≈ 20 pips** (≈ 0.20 %).</li></ul> | **Interpretation** <br>‑ Over the next half‑day we can expect the price to wander about **± 20 pips** (1 σ). <br>‑ This helps us size stops and targets so they are realistic relative to normal market moves. |

---

## 5. Forecast the price path for the next 12 hours

| Tool | Call | Why we used it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **`forecast_generate`** | `symbol=EURUSD`, `timeframe=H1`, `library=native`, `method=theta`, `horizon=12`, `quantity=price` | <ul><li>The **Theta** method is a fast, reliable forecasting model that works well on short‑term series.</li><li>We ask for a **price forecast** (not returns) for the next 12 hourly bars.</li></ul> |
| **Result** | JSON with: <br>‑ Forecasted price for each of the next 12 hours (≈ 1.17528 → 1.17543). <br>‑ Point-only uncertainty status for native Theta. <br>‑ Trend flag = **up**. | **Interpretation** <br>‑ The model expects a **small pull‑back** toward the pivot (1.1750) before the up‑trend resumes. <br>‑ This point forecast does not establish a risk band; use `forecast_conformal_intervals` when the workflow requires calibrated intervals. |

---

## 6. Find the statistically‑optimal TP/SL (Take‑Profit / Stop‑Loss) levels

| Tool | Call | Why we used it |
|------|------|----------------|
| **`forecast_barrier_optimize`** | `symbol=EURUSD`, `timeframe=H1`, `horizon=12`, `method=hmm_mc`, `mode=pct`, `grid_style=volatility`, `refine=true`, `tp_min=0.25`, `tp_max=1.5`, `tp_steps=7`, `sl_min=0.25`, `sl_max=2.5`, `sl_steps=9`, `objective=edge` | <ul><li>**Monte-Carlo barrier analysis** simulates many possible price paths (here using a **Gaussian HMM** - a regime-switching model that captures changing volatility).</li><li>The volatility-scaled grid spans compact scalps (~0.25%) through swing targets (~1.5%) and lets stops widen automatically (up to ~2.5 multiples), so both defensive and aggressive reward/risk profiles are explored without hand-tuning.</li><li>With `refine=true` the optimizer performs a second, tighter sweep around the initial best combo.</li><li>The **objective "edge"** = *P(TP first) - P(SL first)*, i.e., the net probability of a winning trade.</li></ul> |
| **Result** | JSON with a 7x9 grid (63 combos). Each candidate includes TP/SL hit probabilities, resolve probability, edge, Kelly, EV (plus conditional and per-bar variants), and median time-to-hit stats. | **Interpretation** <br>- Use `objective=edge` for setups where TP-first odds are the priority; switch to `kelly`, `ev`, `ev_cond`, or `ev_per_bar` when payoff asymmetry or time-to-resolution matters more. <br>- Wider stops now show up in the default grid, so you can choose conservative ratios without redefining the search space. |

## 7. Putting it all together – Trade ideas

| Step | How the previous outputs shaped the idea |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| **Current market picture** (Step 1 & 3) | Price is above the 20‑EMA, below R1, and near the daily pivot → likely to **pull back** to the pivot before trying to break R1. |
| **Volatility check** (Step 4) | 12‑hour σ ≈ 20 pips → a 0.20 % TP (≈ 23 pips) is roughly **one‑sigma** away, a realistic target; a 1 % SL (≈ 118 pips) is far beyond normal moves, making the stop unlikely to be hit. |
| **Forecast** (Step 5) | The Theta forecast expects the price to settle around **1.1753**, i.e., near the pivot, confirming a short‑term pull‑back. |
| **Barrier optimisation** (Step 6) | Quantifies the **edge** of each TP/SL pair, giving us the **statistically‑best** setups (0.20 %/1 % and 0.40 %/0.80 %). |
| **Resulting trade plan** | • **Primary long**: Enter near the pivot (≈ 1.1750), TP = 0.20 % (≈ 1.1785), SL = 1.00 % (≈ 1.1658). <br>• **Secondary long** (more balanced): TP = 0.40 % (≈ 1.1795), SL = 0.80 % (≈ 1.1680). <br>• **Short‑term counter‑trend**: If price cleanly closes above R1, consider a short with TP back to the pivot and a modest SL. |

## TL;DR — the “why” in plain English

1. **Recent prices + a few indicators** (EMAs, RSI, MACD) for short-term trend and momentum.
2. **Daily high/low/close → pivot levels** so you know nearby support and resistance.
3. **Volatility** (how far price usually travels over the next half-day).
4. **A forecast** for the next 12 hours (here: a modest pull-back toward the pivot).
5. **Barrier simulation** to score many TP/SL pairs and highlight statistical edge.
6. **Combine** structure, vol, forecast, and barriers into concrete setups with entry, target, and stop.

That is the full path from raw candles to research ideas you can stress-test further. It is **not** a guaranteed trade.
