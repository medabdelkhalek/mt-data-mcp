## HOW TO ADD A FORECAST METHOD

1. Create class in `methods/` implementing `ForecastMethod` ABC from `interface.py`
2. Implement `name`, `category`, `required_packages`, `forecast()` method
3. Register in `forecast_registry.py` mapping name → class
4. If new dependency needed, add to appropriate group in `pyproject.toml`

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- **Never** re-normalize already-normalized time data — see `common.py` comment.
- **Never** import all methods eagerly — some have heavy deps (torch, QuantLib). Use lazy imports.
- Methods in `forecast-foundation` group require GPU-capable torch — guard with try/except on import.
- Prefer `forecast_train` + `forecast_task_wait`/`forecast_task_status` for explicit model training; trainable methods now run through the durable task runtime rather than ad-hoc sync execution.
